Q: You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
A: First, we add "dotenv": "^8.2.0" dependency in our "package.json" file to be able to use it. Then we create ".env" file and put sensitive information there and store it in a variable. We should add the password in the copied link from Mongo DB. Then in app.js we add "require("dotenv").config()". Then we setup a function "start" using async/await pattern and put our variable with sensitive information to the "connectDB(process.env.MONGO_URI)". Then we configure the port, so it could be invoked only if the connection is established. "connectDB" is a function which include Mongoose connection setup.

Q: How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
